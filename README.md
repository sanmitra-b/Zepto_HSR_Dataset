## 🛒 Zepto HSR Layout – Pricing & Demand Analysis Dataset (6454 Products)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **primary dataset and end-to-end data pipeline** designed for analyzing pricing strategy, discount behavior, demand intensity, and competitive signals in the quick-commerce industry.

The dataset was collected from a Zepto dark store serving **HSR Layout, Bangalore** — a high-footfall and digitally mature urban locality that serves as a strong proxy for urban Bangalore consumption patterns.

📅 **Data Collection Date:** February 17 (Tuesday)
📍 **Context:** Non-festival, regular weekday
🎯 **Objective:** Build a modeling-ready dataset for pricing, demand, and competitive analysis.

# 🔎 Data Collection

Data was collected using a structured API scraping strategy implemented in:

📄 `zepto_scraper.py` 

### 🔹 Key Features of Scraper

* Uses Zepto search API endpoint
* Systematic category-based search queries
* Pagination handling
* Deduplication using `Product Variant ID`
* Structured Excel export
* Store-specific extraction (HSR Layout)

Each row represents a **product variant** available at the dark store at the time of scraping.

---

# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Cleaning and feature engineering were performed in:

📓 `DDA_Zepto_cleaning.ipynb`

### ✔ Key Cleaning Steps

### 1️⃣ Duplicate Detection

* Rows 6457 onward were exact duplicates of rows 1–6455.
* The second half of the dataset was removed.

### 2️⃣ Image URL Correction

Original paths:

```
cms/product_variant/xxxx.jpeg
```

Converted to:

```
https://cdn.zeptonow.com/cms/product_variant/xxxx.jpeg
```

### 3️⃣ Data Type Standardization

| Column Type | Final Type |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Pricing     | float64    |
| Quantities  | int64      |
| Ratings     | float64    |
| Flags       | bool       |
| Text        | object     |

### 4️⃣ Missing Value Handling

* `Average Rating` → Filled with 0 (no rating)
* `Total Ratings` → Filled with 0
* `L3 Category` → Dropped (90.76% missing)
* Other text columns retained (realistic retail missingness)

### 5️⃣ Discount Validation

Recalculated:

```
Discount % = ((MRP - Selling Price) / MRP) * 100
```

Validated with ±1% tolerance.
No significant mismatches detected.

### 6️⃣ Consistency Checks

* No duplicate Product Variant IDs
* No stock mismatch (0 quantity with in-stock flag)
* Pricing consistency verified

---

# 🧠 Feature Engineering

Two binary classification labels were created.

---

## 🟢 High Discount Flag

```
High_Discount_Flag = True if Discount % >= 20
```

Purpose:

* Model promotional intensity
* Identify aggressive discounting

---

## 🔵 High Demand Flag

Defined as:

```
Total Ratings > 5000 AND Average Rating >= 4.5
```

Purpose:

* Identify highly popular products
* Model demand intensity

---
